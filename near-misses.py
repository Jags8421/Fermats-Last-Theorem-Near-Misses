 * Title: Looking for Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem Near Misses
 * File Name: near-misses.py
 * List of External Files to run the program: None
 * List of External Files the program creates: None

 * Date: 28th July 2024.
 * Explanation: 
    * Program to find the Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses. The Program takes valid inputs from the user (n and k).
    * And finds the near misses of the form x^n + y^n = z^n, where x, y, z, n are positive integers with the following constraints for n and x, y.
    * 2 < n < 12 and 10 <= x <= k and 10 <= y <= k. 
    * For each miss, the program computes the relative miss, prints new smallest relative miss every time and finally printing the Smallest relative miss overall.

 * Function to validate the inputs entered by the User.
 * If the input is invalid, the function will throw a ValueError Exception.
